# Prometheus
Retrotheus - The code in the early stages, mainly displays the wavefunctions. Rough work.

Prometheus - The current code. Each molecule folder, e.g. CO, will have a Prometheus code with the molecule's name also in the title (Prometheus_CO). The Prometheus code requires the additional python scripts: "Atomic_Mass_Key", "Conversions_and_Constants", "Prometheus_Functions".

To try with a new molecule simply take a "Prometheus_??" file from CO (Prometheus_CO), H2 (Prometheus_H2), N2 (Prometheus_N2) or O2 (Prometheus_O2) and replace values etc with the new molecule's data.
